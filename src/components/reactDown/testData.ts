##### Inside the Lighthouse 

Upon entering the lighthouse there’s a wealth of information about the history of the lighthouse and some of the people that have volunteered over the years, some of which is shown in the picture below.

To get to the top, as you can imagine there’s a lot of stairs to climb (144 to be precise). If you’re unfit like me, you might need to take some breaks on the way up. When you reach the top of the spiralling stairs, there’s a short set of extremely steep stairs which is pictured below. The picture does not do it justice. I was extremely conscious about falling back down.

##### The Top

When you finally reach the top after what felt like a lifetime of climbing stairs. You’re greeted with a panoramic view of Withernsea and the surrounding areas.

##### Other Facilities 

Luckily there’s a cafe which serves a selection of cakes and milkshakes for you to refuel after climbing all the stairs. There’s also a nice garden as well as a small art gallery.I would recommend visiting if you’re in the area.
